On startup, ``mongosh`` checks the user's ``HOME`` directory for a
JavaScript file named ``.mongoshrc.js``. If ``.mongoshrc.js`` is found,
``mongosh`` interprets the file before displaying the prompt for the
first time.

If you use the shell to evaluate a JavaScript file or expression,
either by using the :option:`--eval <mongosh --eval>` option on the
command line or by specifying :ref:`a .js file to mongosh
<mdb-shell-execute-file>`, ``mongosh`` reads the ``.mongoshrc.js`` file
*after* the JavaScript has finished processing.

You can prevent ``.mongoshrc.js`` from being loaded from the command
line by using the :option:`--norc <mongosh --norc>` option.

.. note::

   The legacy :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell used a configuation file
   called ``.mongorc.js``. If ``mongosh`` detects this file on startup,
   and ``.mongoshrc.js`` is not present, ``mongosh`` will suggest
   renaming ``.mongorc.js`` to ``.mongoshrc.js``. 

   The legacy ``.mongorc.js`` file will not be loaded.
