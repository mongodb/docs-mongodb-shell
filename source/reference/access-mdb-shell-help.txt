BSON Class Help

``mongosh`` provides help methods for :term:`BSON <BSON>` classes. The

the following commands:

.. code-block:: javascript

   ObjectId.help()

.. code-block:: javascript

   ObjectId().help()

``mongosh`` returns the same output for both ``.help()`` methods:

.. code-block:: javascript
