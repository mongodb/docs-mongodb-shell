   Ensure that the extracted |mdb-shell| binary is in the desired 
   location in your filesystem, then add that location to your ``PATH`` 
   environment variable.

   To add the |mdb-shell| binary's location to your 
   ``PATH`` environment variable:

   1. Open the :guilabel:`Control Panel`.

   #. In the :guilabel:`System and Security` category, click 
      :guilabel:`System`.

   #. Click :guilabel:`Advanced system settings`. The **System 
      Properties** modal displays.

   #. Click :guilabel:`Environment Variables`.

   #. In the *System variables* section, select ``Path`` and click 
      :guilabel:`Edit`. The **Edit environment variable** modal 
      displays.

   #. Click :guilabel:`New` and add the filepath to your ``mongosh`` 
      binary.

   #. Click :guilabel:`OK` to confirm your changes. On each other 
      modal, click :guilabel:`OK` to confirm your changes.

   To confirm that your ``PATH`` environment variable is correctly 
   configured to find ``mongosh``, open a command prompt and enter the 
   ``mongosh --help`` command. If your ``PATH`` is configured 
   correctly, a list of valid commands displays.
