   that the developer could not be identified or verified, perform

   #. Select the *Security and Privacy* pane.

   #. Under the *General* tab, click the button to the right of the
      message about ``mongosh``, labelled either :guilabel:`Open Anyway`
      or :guilabel:`Allow Anyway` depending on your version of macOS.
