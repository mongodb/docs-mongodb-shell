The |mdb-shell| stores logs for each session. The default log location
depends on your operating system.

.. include:: /includes/steps/view-logs.rst

.. tip::
  
   To change where MongoDB Shell writes logs, see
   :ref:`mongosh-log-location`.

Starting in |mdb-shell| 2.4.0, you can use the ``log.getPath()``
command to view the current log file location. For details, see
:ref:`mongosh-custom-log-entries`.
