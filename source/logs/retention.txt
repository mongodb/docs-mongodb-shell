You can customize how |mdb-shell| logs are retained. By default, the
system retains 100 log files for 30 days. You can choose to retain logs
based on a combination of time, file size, and number of log files.

You can specify multiple criteria for log retention. For example, you
can specify a maximum duration for log files of 60 days and a maximum
file size of 2GB. When you specify multiple log retention criteria, log
files are cleaned up when any of the criteria are met.
