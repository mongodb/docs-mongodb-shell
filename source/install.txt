Prerequisites
-------------

To use the |mdb-shell|, you must have a MongoDB deployment to connect
to. 

- For a free cloud-hosted deployment, you can use
  `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs_vsce>`__.

- To learn how to run a local MongoDB deployment, see
  :manual:`Install MongoDB </installation/>`.

      .. include:: /includes/steps/install-shell-windows.rst

      .. note::

         On Windows, ``mongosh`` preferences and configuration options
         are stored in the ``%APPDATA%/mongodb/mongosh`` directory.

      .. _macos-install-homebrew:

      Install with Homebrew
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      .. important::
 
         To view the complete list of system requirements for Homebrew,
         see the
         `Homebrew Website <https://docs.brew.sh/Installation>`__.

      The Homebrew package manager is the recommended installation
      method for ``mongosh`` on macOS. To learn how to manually install
      ``mongosh`` from an archive instead, see
      :ref:`macos-install-archive`.

      Considerations
      ``````````````

      ``mongosh`` installed with Homebrew does not support
      :manual:`automatic client-side field level encryption
      </core/security-automatic-client-side-encryption/>`.

      Procedure
      `````````

      To install ``mongosh`` with Homebrew:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/install-shell-macos-homebrew.rst

      .. _macos-install-archive:

      Install from Tarball
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      To manually install ``mongosh`` using a downloaded ``.tgz``
      tarball:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/install-shell-macos.rst

   .. tab::
      :tabid: linux

      Considerations for Ubuntu
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      - ``mongosh`` is available as a
        :abbr:`PPA (Personal Package Archive)` for Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal)
        and Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic).
        
        - If you are using Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) or Ubuntu 18.04
          (Bionic), use the procedure in the ``.deb`` tab.
        
        - If you are using Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial), you must
          obtain the ``mongosh`` tarball using the procedure in the
          ``.tgz`` tab.
      
      - The ``mongocryptd`` binary in the |mdb-shell| ``.deb`` 
        package does not work on Ubuntu 16.04 or older. On 
        Ubuntu 16.04 and older systems, you must 
        :manual:`install </reference/security-client-side-encryption-appendix/#installation>` 
        the ``mongocryptd`` binary separately to use its 
        functionality in the |mdb-shell|.

      Procedure
      ~~~~~~~~~

      Select the appropriate tab based on your Linux distribution and
      desired package from the tabs below:

      - To install the ``.deb`` package on Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal), Ubuntu
        18.04 (Bionic), and Debian, click the ``.deb`` tab.
      
      - To install the ``.rpm`` package on
        :abbr:`RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)`, click the
        ``.rpm`` tab.

      - To install the ``.tgz`` tarball, click the ``.tgz`` tab.

      .. tabs::
      
         .. tab:: .deb
            :tabid: deb

            .. include:: /includes/steps/install-shell-linux-deb.rst

         .. tab:: .rpm
            :tabid: rpm
            
            .. include:: /includes/steps/install-shell-linux-rpm.rst

         .. tab:: .tgz
            :tabid: tgz
      
            .. include:: /includes/steps/install-shell-linux-generic.rst
