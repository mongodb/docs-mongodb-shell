See the following details about |mdb-shell| logging behavior:

Log Format
~~~~~~~~~~

The |mdb-shell| uses `Newline delimited JSON
<https://github.com/ndjson/ndjson-spec>`__ to store session logs. The
format used for |mdb-shell| logs matches the MongoDB server log format.
For details, see :ref:`log-messages-ref`. 

You can view or tail the logs for a |mdb-shell| session based on its
log ID.
