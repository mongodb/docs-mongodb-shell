Improvements

  - ``show users``
  - ``show profile``
  - ``show logs``
  - ``show log[<name>]``

This release includes an ``.rpm`` artifact which can be downloaded from
the `MongoDB Download Center
<https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community?jmp=docs>`__.

Behavior Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Whenever a command's output includes ``{ ok: 0 }``, ``mongosh`` throws
an exception and does not return the raw output from the server.

The legacy ``mongo`` shell error handling is not consistent between
commands. ``mongosh`` standardizes the user-facing behavior for a
more consistent experience.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- :issue:`MONGOSH-323 <MONGOSH-323>`: getUser() userId field is
  outputted as binary.

- :issue:`MONGOSH-337 <MONGOSH-337>`: Linux tarball is not gzipped.

- :issue:`MONGOSH-341 <MONGOSH-341>`: Wrong values with NumberLong for
  numbers > Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER. As a result of this fix, values
  passed to ``NumberLong`` and ``NumberDecimal`` must be strings.

  .. important::

     The fix for :issue:`MONGOSH-341 <MONGOSH-341>` is a breaking
     change when compared to behavior in the legacy ``mongo`` shell.

- :issue:`MONGOSH-346 <MONGOSH-346>`: ``Ctrl+C`` does not terminate the
  currently running command in the shell.

  .. note::

     ``Ctrl+C`` terminates the process in the shell, but does not
     terminate the process on the MongoDB server.

v0.2.2
------

*Released August 31, 2020*

API Additions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release adds support for the following APIs:

- Admin commands such as :method:`db.killOp()` and
  :method:`db.currentOp()`. More detail in
  :issue:`MONGOSH-307 <MONGOSH-307>`.


- Free monitoring commands such as :method:`db.enableFreeMonitoring()`.
  More detail in  :issue:`MONGOSH-300 <MONGOSH-300>`.
    
- Logging and profiling helper method implementations
  (e.g. :method:`db.setLogLevel()`, :method:`db.getProfilingLevel()`).
  More detail in :issue:`MONGOSH-299 <MONGOSH-299>`.

- Raw command execution methods helpers (e.g.
  :method:`db.listCommands()`). More detail in
  :issue:`MONGOSH-301 <MONGOSH-301>`.

- Server stats commands such as :method:`db.serverBuildInfo()` and
  :method:`db.serverStatus()`. More detail in
  :issue:`MONGOSH-304 <MONGOSH-304>`.

- Bulk API support. Details in :issue:`MONGOSH-296 <MONGOSH-296>`.
