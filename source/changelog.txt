`Full release notes available on JIRA
<https://jira.mongodb.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=17381&version=34315>`__.

v1.5.4
------

*Released July 31, 2022*

Fixes a potential data corruption bug in
:method:`KeyVault.rewrapManyDataKey()` when rotating encrypted data
encryption keys backed by Azure or GCP key services.

In previous versions of ``mongosh``, this bug occurs when an
Azure-backed or GCP-backed data encryption key being rewrapped requires
fetching an access token for decryption of the data encryption key.

As a result of this bug, all data encryption keys being rewrapped are
replaced by new randomly generated material, destroying the original key
material.

To mitigate potential data corruption, upgrade ``mongosh`` to v1.5.4 or
higher before using :method:`KeyVault.rewrapManyDataKey()` to rotate
Azure-backed or GCP-backed data encryption keys. You should always
create a backup of the key vault collection before key rotation.

v1.5.3
------

*Released July 29, 2022*

Updates telemetry internals.

  .. note::
  
     ``config`` settings persist across sessions.

- On Windows,  you can start ``mongosh`` by double-clicking on the
  ``.exe`` file. When you do, ``mongosh`` prompts you for a connection
  string to connect to your deployment.

  newline-delimited JSON with the same set of fields used by the server.

- An issue that sporadically resulted in an ``AcquireCredentialsHandle``
  error on Kerberos was fixed.

- Miscellaneous other improvements.


v1.0
----

*Released July 9, 2021*

New features in this release:

  available. Specifically, you can use

  legacy shell’s ``ObjectId.fromDate(dateObj)``.

- When connected to an Atlas deployment, the default ``mongosh`` prompt
  displays ``Atlas`` instead of ``Enterprise``.

- The :manual:`cursor </tutorial/iterate-a-cursor/>` referred to when
  using ``it`` is cleared when either ``db`` is reassigned or

  - ``show profile``

This release includes an ``.rpm`` artifact which can be downloaded from
the `MongoDB Download Center
<https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community?jmp=docs>`__.

Behavior Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Whenever a command's output includes ``{ ok: 0 }``, ``mongosh`` throws
an exception and does not return the raw output from the server.

The legacy ``mongo`` shell error handling is not consistent between
commands. ``mongosh`` standardizes the user-facing behavior for a
more consistent experience.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- :issue:`MONGOSH-323 <MONGOSH-323>`: getUser() userId field is
  outputted as binary.

- :issue:`MONGOSH-337 <MONGOSH-337>`: Linux tarball is not gzipped.

- :issue:`MONGOSH-341 <MONGOSH-341>`: Wrong values with NumberLong for
  numbers > Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER. As a result of this fix, values
  passed to ``NumberLong`` and ``NumberDecimal`` must be strings.

  .. important::

     The fix for :issue:`MONGOSH-341 <MONGOSH-341>` is a breaking
     change when compared to behavior in the legacy ``mongo`` shell.

- :issue:`MONGOSH-346 <MONGOSH-346>`: ``Ctrl+C`` does not terminate the
  currently running command in the shell.

  .. note::

     ``Ctrl+C`` terminates the process in the shell, but does not
     terminate the process on the MongoDB server.

v0.2.2
------

*Released August 31, 2020*

- Admin commands such as :method:`db.killOp()` and
  :method:`db.currentOp()`. More detail in
  :issue:`MONGOSH-307 <MONGOSH-307>`.


- Free monitoring commands such as :method:`db.enableFreeMonitoring()`.
  More detail in  :issue:`MONGOSH-300 <MONGOSH-300>`.
    
- Logging and profiling helper method implementations

  More detail in :issue:`MONGOSH-299 <MONGOSH-299>`.
