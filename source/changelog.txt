v1.0.6
------

*Released September 14, 2021*

New features in this release:

  ``mongos``, for example when connected to a
  :manual:`config server </core/sharded-cluster-config-servers/>`.

- ``db.setSecondaryOk()``, ``mongo.setSecondaryOk()``, and
  ``rs.secondaryOk()`` methods are reintroduced but **deprecated**.
  These methods alias to ``mongo.setReadPref()``.

- When you enter multiline input into the shell, single-line
  ``// comments`` are now preserved as ``/* comments */`` in the
  history entry.

  :method:`db.collection.watch()`, :method:`db.watch()`, and
  :method:`Mongo.watch()`.

  :pipeline:`$merge` immediately, and not lazily once the result of the
  aggregation is accessed.

- Using the legacy ``NumberLong()`` method no longer truncates numbers
  outside of the 32-bit range.

<https://jira.mongodb.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=17381&version=31793>`__.

v1.0.5
------

*Released August 12, 2021*

New features in this release:

- You can use ``config.set('maxTimeMS', <number>)`` to set a default
  ``maxTimeMS`` value for operations. ``maxTimeMS`` specifies a time
  limit in milliseconds within which the operation must complete.

  .. note::
  
     ``config`` settings persist across sessions.

- On Windows,  you can start ``mongosh`` by double-clicking on the
  ``.exe`` file. When you do, ``mongosh`` prompts you for a connection
  string to connect to your deployment.

- The log files created by ``mongosh`` follow the format of the
  ``mongod``, ``mongos``, or ``mongocryptd``. Meaning, the log files are
  newline-delimited JSON with the same set of fields used by the server.

v1.0.4
------

*Released August 4, 2021*

New features in this release:

- ``mongosh`` now uses version ``4.1.0`` of the Node.js driver, with
  full support for connections to load balancers and MongoDB Atlas
  :atlas:`serverless instances </tutorial/create-new-serverless-instance/>`.

Bug fixes in this release:

- The ``Timestamp()`` argument order is now reversed compared to
  previous ``mongosh`` versions.


v1.0.3
------

*Released July 29, 2021*

Bug fixes in this release:

- Passing the exit code to ``quit()`` works like it does in the legacy
  shell.

- Instances of ``MaxListenersExceededWarning`` are no longer emitted
  when methods like ``console.log()`` are used in loops.

- When an internal error in ``mongosh`` occurs, the error message
  points you to the log file for the current ``mongosh`` session.

- When printing the name of a collection (such as in response to
  ``db.coll``), the database name is included in the output.

v1.0.1
------

*Released July 21, 2021*

New features in this release:

- Adds full support for the ``--host`` flag.

- Adds the ``--build-info`` flag which provides detailed information
  about the ``mongosh`` version.

- When using Kerberos, ``mongosh`` will now make use of tokens if they
  are still valid. You no longer need to specify a password when using
  valid tokens.

Bug fixes in this release:

- An issue that sporadically resulted in an ``AcquireCredentialsHandle``
  error on Kerberos was fixed.

- Miscellaneous other improvements.


v1.0
----

*Released July 9, 2021*

New features in this release:

- All the static methods of the Node.js driver BSON classes are now
  available. Specifically, you can use
  ``ObjectId.createFromTime(unixTimestampSeconds)`` instead of the
  legacy shell’s ``ObjectId.fromDate(dateObj)``.

- When connected to an Atlas deployment, the default ``mongosh`` prompt
  displays ``Atlas`` instead of ``Enterprise``.

- The :manual:`cursor </tutorial/iterate-a-cursor/>` referred to when
  using ``it`` is cleared when either ``db`` is reassigned or
  ``db.auth()`` / ``db.logout()`` is called.

- Minor bug fixes and improvements.

Behavior Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Whenever a command's output includes ``{ ok: 0 }``, ``mongosh`` throws
an exception and does not return the raw output from the server.

The legacy ``mongo`` shell error handling is not consistent between
commands. ``mongosh`` standardizes the user-facing behavior for a
more consistent experience.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- :issue:`MONGOSH-323 <MONGOSH-323>`: getUser() userId field is
  outputted as binary.

- :issue:`MONGOSH-337 <MONGOSH-337>`: Linux tarball is not gzipped.

- :issue:`MONGOSH-341 <MONGOSH-341>`: Wrong values with NumberLong for
  numbers > Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER. As a result of this fix, values
  passed to ``NumberLong`` and ``NumberDecimal`` must be strings.

  .. important::

     The fix for :issue:`MONGOSH-341 <MONGOSH-341>` is a breaking
     change when compared to behavior in the legacy ``mongo`` shell.

- :issue:`MONGOSH-346 <MONGOSH-346>`: ``Ctrl+C`` does not terminate the
  currently running command in the shell.

  .. note::

     ``Ctrl+C`` terminates the process in the shell, but does not
     terminate the process on the MongoDB server.

v0.2.2
------

*Released August 31, 2020*

API Additions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release adds support for the following APIs:

- Admin commands such as :method:`db.killOp()` and
  :method:`db.currentOp()`. More detail in
  :issue:`MONGOSH-307 <MONGOSH-307>`.


- Free monitoring commands such as :method:`db.enableFreeMonitoring()`.
  More detail in  :issue:`MONGOSH-300 <MONGOSH-300>`.
    
- Logging and profiling helper method implementations
  (for example, :method:`db.setLogLevel()`).
  More detail in :issue:`MONGOSH-299 <MONGOSH-299>`.

- Raw command execution methods helpers (e.g.
  :method:`db.listCommands()`). More detail in
  :issue:`MONGOSH-301 <MONGOSH-301>`.

- Server stats commands such as :method:`db.serverBuildInfo()` and
  :method:`db.serverStatus()`. More detail in
  :issue:`MONGOSH-304 <MONGOSH-304>`.

- Bulk API support. Details in :issue:`MONGOSH-296 <MONGOSH-296>`.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~
