The |mdb-shell| is a fully functional JavaScript environment for
interacting with MongoDB deployments. You can use the |mdb-shell| to
test queries and operations directly with your database.

The |mdb-shell| is available as a standalone package in the MongoDB
download center.

Download and Install the |mdb-shell|
------------------------------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use the |mdb-shell|, you must have a MongoDB deployment to connect
to. 

- For a free cloud-hosted deployment, you can use
  `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs_vsce>`__.

- To learn how to run a local MongoDB deployment, see
  :manual:`Install MongoDB </installation/>`.

Connect to a MongoDB Deployment
-------------------------------

Once you have installed the |mdb-shell| and added it to you system
``PATH``, you can connect to a MongoDB deployment. To learn more, see
:ref:`mdb-shell-connect`.

Multi-Line Operations in the |mdb-shell|
----------------------------------------

Run the ``.editor`` command within the |mdb-shell| to open the editor
and manage comprehensive multiline functions:

.. example::

   Run the following command within the |mdb-shell|:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      .editor

   The |mdb-shell| enters editor mode:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      // Entering editor mode (^D to finish, ^C to cancel)
      const { Writable } = require('stream');

        const myWritable = new Writable({
          write(chunk, encoding, callback) {
            // ...
          },
          writev(chunks, callback) {
            // ...
          }
        });

- Press ``Cmd/Ctrl`` + ``d`` to finish and run your function.

- Press ``Cmd/Ctrl`` + ``c`` to cancel and exit without running your
  function.

When you close the editor, the |mdb-shell| does not save any functions
you had entered into the editor.

.. note::

   Currently, ``editor()`` is the only way to paste multiline commands
   into the |mdb-shell|.


The |mdb-shell| versus the Legacy ``mongo`` Shell
-------------------------------------------------

The |mdb-shell| offers numerous advantages over the legacy
:binary:`mongo <mongo>` shell, such as:

- Improved syntax highlighting.

- Improved command history.

- Improved logging.

During the beta stage, the |mdb-shell| supports a subset of the legacy
:binary:`mongo <mongo>` shell commands. Extending the |mdb-shell| |api|
coverage is an ongoing effort.

The commands that the |mdb-shell| supports use the same syntax as the
corresponding commands in the legacy :binary:`mongo <mongo>` shell.
