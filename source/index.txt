The |mdb-shell|, ``mongosh``, is a fully functional JavaScript and 
Node.js 16.x |repl| environment for interacting with MongoDB 
deployments. You can use the |mdb-shell| to test queries and operations 
directly with your database.

:binary:`~bin.mongosh` is available as a standalone package in the
`MongoDB Download Center
<https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell?jmp=docs>`__.

Download and Install ``mongosh``
--------------------------------

To learn how to download and install the ``mongosh`` binary, see
:ref:`mdb-shell-install`.

Connect to a MongoDB Deployment
-------------------------------

Once you have installed the |mdb-shell| and added it to your system
``PATH``, you can connect to a MongoDB deployment. To learn more, see
:ref:`mdb-shell-connect`.

The |mdb-shell| versus the Legacy ``mongo`` Shell
-------------------------------------------------

The legacy ``mongo`` shell was deprecated in MongoDB 5.0 and removed in
MongoDB 6.0. The new MongoDB Shell, ``mongosh``, offers numerous
advantages over the legacy shell. The new shell has improved:

- compatibility with the MongoDB `Node.js
  <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/>`__ driver
- syntax highlighting
- command history
- logging

Some legacy methods are unavailable or have been replaced with updated
methods in ``mongosh``. To maintain backwards compatibility, the legacy
methods that ``mongosh`` supports use the same syntax as the
corresponding methods in the ``mongo`` shell. 

To see the complete list of methods supported by ``mongosh``, refer to:
:doc:`MongoDB Shell Methods </reference/methods>`.
