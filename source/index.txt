The |mdb-shell|, ``mongosh``, is a fully functional JavaScript and 
Node.js 14.x |repl| environment for interacting with MongoDB 
deployments. You can use the |mdb-shell| to test queries and operations 
directly with your database.

``mongosh`` is available as a standalone package in the MongoDB
download center.

Download and Install ``mongosh``
--------------------------------

To learn how to download and install the ``mongosh`` binary, see
:ref:`mdb-shell-install`.

Connect to a MongoDB Deployment
-------------------------------

Once you have installed the |mdb-shell| and added it to your system
``PATH``, you can connect to a MongoDB deployment. To learn more, see
:ref:`mdb-shell-connect`.

.. _mdb-shell-multi-line:

|mdb-shell| Editor Mode
-----------------------

Run the ``.editor`` command within the |mdb-shell| to open the editor
and manage comprehensive multiline functions:

.. example::

   Run the following command within the |mdb-shell|:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      .editor

   The |mdb-shell| enters editor mode:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      // Entering editor mode (^D to finish, ^C to cancel)
      const { Writable } = require('stream');

        const myWritable = new Writable({
          write(chunk, encoding, callback) {
            // ...
          },
          writev(chunks, callback) {
            // ...
          }
        });

- Press ``Cmd/Ctrl`` + ``d`` to finish and run your function.

- Press ``Cmd/Ctrl`` + ``c`` to cancel and exit without running your
  function.

When you close the editor, the |mdb-shell| does not save any functions
you had entered into the editor.

The |mdb-shell| versus the Legacy ``mongo`` Shell
-------------------------------------------------

The new MongoDB Shell, ``mongosh``, offers numerous
advantages over the legacy :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, such as:

- Improved syntax highlighting.

- Improved command history.

- Improved logging.

During the beta stage, ``mongosh`` supports a subset of the
:binary:`~bin.mongo` shell methods. Achieving feature parity between
``mongosh`` and the ``mongo`` shell is an ongoing effort.

To maintain backwards compatibility, the methods that ``mongosh``
supports use the same syntax as the corresponding methods in the
:binary:`~bin.mongo` shell. To see the complete list of methods
supported by ``mongosh``, see
:doc:`MongoDB Shell Methods </reference/methods>`.
