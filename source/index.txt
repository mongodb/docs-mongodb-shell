The |mdb-shell|, ``mongosh``, is a fully functional JavaScript and 
Node.js 14.x |repl| environment for interacting with MongoDB 
deployments. You can use the |mdb-shell| to test queries and operations 
directly with your database.

:binary:`~bin.mongosh` is available as a standalone package in the
MongoDB download center.

Download and Install ``mongosh``
--------------------------------

To learn how to download and install the :binary:`~bin.mongosh` binary,
see :ref:`mdb-shell-install`.

Connect to a MongoDB Deployment
-------------------------------

Once you have installed the |mdb-shell| and added it to your system
``PATH``, you can connect to a MongoDB deployment. To learn more, see
:ref:`mdb-shell-connect`.

.. _mdb-shell-multi-line:

``mongosh`` Editor Mode
-----------------------

The :binary:`~bin.mongosh` console is line oriented. However, you can
also use an editor to work with multiline functions. There are two
options:

- An external editor, accessed with the ``edit`` command
- A built-in editor, accessed with the ``.editor`` command

For further details see :ref:`mongosh-editor-mode`.

The |mdb-shell| versus the Legacy ``mongo`` Shell
-------------------------------------------------

The new MongoDB Shell, ``mongosh``, offers numerous
advantages over the legacy :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, such as:

- Improved syntax highlighting.

- Improved command history.

- Improved logging.

Currently ``mongosh`` supports a subset of the :binary:`~bin.mongo`
shell methods. Achieving feature parity between ``mongosh`` and the
``mongo`` shell is an ongoing effort.

To maintain backwards compatibility, the methods that ``mongosh``
supports use the same syntax as the corresponding methods in the
:binary:`~bin.mongo` shell. To see the complete list of methods
supported by ``mongosh``, see
:doc:`MongoDB Shell Methods </reference/methods>`.
