This document provides a brief overview of the help available in
:binary:`~bin.mongosh`. 

.. _mongosh-help-command-line:

Command Line Help
-----------------

To see the options for running the :binary:`~bin.mongosh` executable
and connecting to a deployment, use the :option:`--help <mongosh
--help>` option from the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

   mongosh --help

``mongosh`` Shell Help
----------------------

To see the help available in the :binary:`~bin.mongosh` console, type
``help`` inside a running :binary:`~bin.mongosh` console:

.. code-block:: javascript

   help

.. _mongo-shell-help-db:

Database Help
-------------

You can view database level information from inside the
:binary:`~bin.mongosh` console:

- By default :binary:`~bin.mongosh` shows the current database in the
  prompt. You can also see the current database by running the ``db``
  command:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db

- To see the list of databases available to you on the server, use the
  ``show dbs`` command:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     show dbs

  ``show databases`` is an alias for ``show dbs``.
  
  .. tip::
  
     The list of databases will change depending on your access
     authorizations. For more information on access restrictions for
     viewing databases, see :dbcommand:`listDatabases`.

- To see help for the available :manual:`database methods
  </reference/method/js-database/>` you can use with the ``db`` object,
  run :method:`db.help()`:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.help()

.. _mongosh-help-collection:

Collection Help
---------------

You can view collection level information from inside the
:binary:`~bin.mongosh` console.

These help methods accept a collection name, ``<collection>``, but you
can also use the generic term, "collection", or even a collection that
does not exist.

- By default :binary:`~bin.mongosh` shows the current database in the
  prompt. To see the list of collections in the current database, use
  the ``show collections`` command:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     show collections

- To see the help for methods available on collection objects
  use ``db.<collection>.help()`` method:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.collection.help()

- To see the help for a particular method, use 
  ``db.<collection>.<method>.help()``:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.collection.getIndexes.help()


.. _mongosh-help-cursor:

Cursor Help
-----------

Use :ref:`cursor methods <mongosh-cursor-methods>` to modify
:ref:`read operations <read-operations-queries>` that use
:method:`~db.collection.find()`.

- To list the available modifier and cursor handling methods, use the
  ``db.collection.find().help()`` command:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.collection.find().help()

This help call accepts a collection name, ``<collection>``, but you
can also use the generic term, "collection", or even a collection which
does not exist.

Some useful methods for handling cursors are:

- :method:`~cursor.hasNext()` checks if the cursor has more documents.

- :method:`~cursor.next()` returns the next document and moves the
  cursor position forward by one.

- :method:`forEach(\<function\>) <cursor.forEach()>`  applies the
  ``<function>`` to each document returned by the cursor.

For a list of available cursor methods, see :ref:`js-query-cursor-methods`.

  - :ref:`run-commands` provides guidance on how to use
    :binary:`~bin.mongosh`.
  - :ref:`mdb-shell-methods` lists available methods.
